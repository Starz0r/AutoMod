## Goals
Discord moderation tools are severely lacking, this is my attempt at rectifying the situation by creating a bot with multiple commands to assist with moderation. Additionally I'd like to create a web dashboard for another things like monitoring and tracking what actions have been taken, and by what user as any action performed by the bot obfuscate the actual user performing the action.
